# GHC Website
My church website has not been in too great condition, this repository is **not in use** nor are there plans to implement it.
Rather this was created to see what it would be like to hand-code the website instead of using WordPress and to see if a Django-based website would be what's best for us.

The conclusion was no, but this repository was where I learned Bootstrap, docker, and celery, and worked on my Django skills, so I'm not mad about it at all. 
Check out the WordPress website we chose to use at https://graceheritage.org!
